# FetchAPI
This website functionality involves creating a JavaScript-based application to fetch and display data from a mock API and filter the results based on user input.

# The website has the following primary functionality:

**Fetching Data from a Mock API:

It uses the mock API at https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts to retrieve a list of posts.

The API provides data in JSON format, including post titles and content.

**Filtering Based on User Input:

Users provide a keyword (e.g., "magnam").

The application filters the posts to show only those that contain the keyword in their title.

**Displaying Results:

Filtered results are displayed on the webpage.

Only relevant posts matching the search criteria are shown.

**Error Handling:

Proper error handling is implemented using try and catch blocks to manage API failures or unexpected issues.
